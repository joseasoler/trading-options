![Mod settings image](Preview/ui.png?raw=true)

By tweaking the settings of this mod you can easily change:

• How frequently caravans, orbital traders or visitors will arrive at the colony.

• Amount of silver in stock for any trader type.

• Amount of other stock for any trader type.

• Make traders have more items in stock if your colony is wealthy.

• Slaver traders appear regardless of your colony population.

It is safe to add Trading Options to an existing savegame. You can safely modify any of the settings at any point during the game. Changes will only apply to new traders, and to settlements after they restock.

Trading Options is compatible with all mods that change the stock of a trader. The changes stack. Trading Options is probably incompatible with any mod that changes trader frequency.
